                    During the second trimester of pregnancy, you might experience physical

                            As your uterus expands to make room for the baby, your belly grows.
                            Your breasts will also gradually continue to increase in size.

                            You might feel these mild, irregular contractions as a slight
                            tightness in your abdomen. They're more likely to occur in the
                            afternoon or evening, after physical activity. Contact your health
                            care provider if the contractions become regular and steadily
                            increase in strength. This could be a sign of preterm labor.

                            Hormonal changes during pregnancy stimulate an increase in
                            pigment-bearing cells (melanin) in your skin. As a result, you
                            might notice brown patches on your face (melasma). You might also
                            see a dark line down your abdomen (linea nigra). These skin changes
                            are common and usually fade after delivery. Sun exposure, however,
                            can aggravate the issue. When you're outdoors, use sunscreen. You
                            might also notice reddish-brown, black, silver or purple lines
                            along your abdomen, breasts, buttocks or thighs (stretch marks).
                            Although stretch marks can't be prevented, most eventually fade in
                            intensity.

                            During pregnancy, your hormone levels increase and your body makes
                            more blood. This can cause your mucous membranes to swell and bleed
                            easily, resulting in stuffiness and nosebleeds. Saline drops or a
                            saline rinse can help relieve congestion. Also, drink plenty of
                            fluids, use a humidifier, and dab petroleum jelly around the edges
                            of your nostrils to help moisten skin.

                            Pregnancy can cause your gums to become more sensitive to flossing
                            and brushing, resulting in minor bleeding. Rinsing with salt water
                            and switching to a softer toothbrush can decrease irritation.
                            Frequent vomiting could also affect your tooth enamel and make you
                            more susceptible to cavities. Be sure to keep up your dental care
                            during pregnancy.

                            If you're having trouble with dizziness, drink plenty of fluids,
                            avoid standing for long periods, and move slowly when you stand up

                            night. To prevent them, stretch your calf muscles before bed, stay
                            physically active, and drink plenty of fluids.

                            by pain, soreness or itching in your vaginal area. This could
                            indicate a vaginal infection.

                    According to WHO rules <strong>During the second trimester</strong> (14
                    weeks <strong>to</strong> 27 weeks), you'll typically <strong>see</strong>
                    your healthcare practitioner once every four weeks unless you have a
                    condition or complications that call for more frequent checkups. Here's

                    During the second trimester, your prenatal appointments will focus on your
                    baby's growth and detecting any health problems. Your health care provider
                    will begin by checking your weight and blood pressure. He or she might
                    measure the size of your uterus by checking your fundal height — the
                    distance from your pubic bone to the top of your uterus (fundus).

                    your baby's heartbeat. Your health care provider might suggest an
                    ultrasound or other screening tests this trimester. You might also find out
                    your baby's sex — if you choose.

                    Miscarriages in the second trimester (before 20 weeks) may be caused by
                    several different factors, which can include:

                    If preterm labor can’t be stopped, your doctor will give you a steroid
                    medication. Doing so helps develop the baby’s lungs and reduces the

                    The cervix is a tissue that connects the vagina and the uterus. Sometimes,

                    This condition is known as cervical incompetence, or cervical
                    insufficiency. While it’s an uncommon condition, it can cause serious

                    The opening and thinning of the cervix eventually leads to the rupture of
                    membranes and delivery of a very premature fetus. This usually occurs
                    around the 20th week of pregnancy. Since the fetus is too premature to
                    survive outside the uterus at that point, the pregnancy often can’t be
                    saved.

                    Unlike preterm labor, cervical incompetence typically doesn’t cause pain or
                    contractions. There may be vaginal bleeding or discharge.

                    Treatment
                </h3>
                <p align="justify">
                    Treatment for cervical incompetence is limited. An emergency cerclage
                    (stitch around the cervix) is a possibility if the membranes haven’t
                    ruptured yet. The risk of rupturing the membranes is higher if the cervix
                    is very dilated (wide). Extended bed rest is necessary after the placement
                    of a cerclage.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    In other cases, when the membranes have already ruptured and the fetus is
                    old enough to survive, your doctor will likely induce labor.

                    You can prevent cervical incompetence. If you have a history of it, you can
                    receive a cerclage with future pregnancies at about 14 weeks. This will
                    lower, but not eliminate, the risk of having a preterm delivery and losing
                    the baby.Preeclampsia

                    Consider adding grab bars or rails in your shower, too. Also check your
